<h1>Simplification Method: The Karnaugh Map</h1>

<h2>I. Introduction:</h2>
<p>
    In a previous lesson (on Boolean logic), we learned that the method of simplifying equations by performing
    successive factorizations became very time-consuming and tedious as the number of variables increased.
    The Karnaugh map method allows us to perform simplifications much more quickly without having to write long equations.
</p>

<h2>II. The Karnaugh Map:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It is a table of 2<sup>n</sup> cases, n being the number of variables.</li>
    <li>On the lines and columns, we place the state of the input variables in reflected binary code (Gray code).</li>
    <li>In each of the cases, we place the state of the output for the corresponding input combinations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, the number of variables is 4 because the Karnaugh Map contains 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 cases.</p>

<h2>III. Simplification of equations from the Karnaugh Map:</h2>
<p>
    The method consists of graphically highlighting, by a graphic process, the terms of a logic function that differ
    only by the state of a single variable (terms adjacent to each other). If the function logic depends on N variables,
    there are 2<sup>N</sup> possible cases (principle of the truth table).

<p class="remark">
    <span class="remark-title">Remarks:</span><br>
    - One or more cases can be common to several groupings.<br>
    - To extract the equation of the function logic, we only retain the variables whose state does not change within a grouping and we apply the same logic (OR) to all the proven groupings.<br>
    - Grouping of 6 cases is impossible.
